### Steps to run ###
1. Add all of the files in folder "franchise" to workspace via command palette

2. Use the docker file to build the "franchise" image, then change CMD line to run flask.

3. Take that franchise image and add it as a base image in docker compose under services

4. Add a postgres base image to docker services, in the docker compose file and create a volume that holds the franchise database, from
   the file system.
   Once the volume in psql is created all the commands is executed from init.sql that will create and seed the database.

5. Execute docker compose up -d to build and run the franchise flask app automatically running flask server, with the corresponding
   postgress database it requires.
